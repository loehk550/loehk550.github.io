        <br />
        <p> 
            In the United States, there are an estimated 32,101 pregnancies that result from rape each year.  Approximately 32% of the women in this difficult situation choose to carry the pregnancy to term and keep custody of the child.  Depending on what state each of these estimated 10,000 women live in, they may be forced by state law to share custody of the child with their rapist. There are 14 states in the US that do not allow for the termination of parental rights (TPR) of a father even when that father is convicted of the rape that resulted in the pregnancy.
